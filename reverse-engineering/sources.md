  - Videos are on Youtube
  - Pretty good, long-form lecture type stuff
  - Content's pretty great, video quality is ehhhhh, but that's OK by me

  - Got access to this via work, so might not be financially viable for everyone
  - There's a book on there: "Beginning x64 Assembly Programming: From Novice to AVX Professional" which has been pretty helpful.
