- Use `lsb_release -a` and `uname -a` to obtain basic information about kernel/distro versions.
  - You can then look up on Google for known privilege escalation paths in these versions.
- `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null` will show you all the SUID files on the system
- `find / -group <group>` will show you items owned by the given group
- `find / -user <user>` will show you items owned by the given user
- `sudo -l` lists the current user's `sudo` permissions (use this to find things which you can run as root). Especially be on the lookout for applications which can execute user-provided code/commands (e.g. Vi). You could then use those to run commands as root. 
- Nano can be used to display the contents of accessible files (Ctrl-R)
