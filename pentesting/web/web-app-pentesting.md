# Process for Web App Pentesting

Note that this is flexible, and can be adjusted on a case-by-case basis as necessary. More detailed tips are available in `pentesting/Methodologies.md`.

1. **Manual spidering**
   
   Get a feel for the target, browse the site manually, using something like Burp to keep track of pages visited and such. Make sure to go through any registration/login/forgot password flows.
2. **Automated spidering**
   
   Use Burp/dirb/dirbuster/wfuzz to automatically find anything you missed when searching manually. Definitely make use of multiple tools and wordlists, to get the most information.
3. **Vulnerability-search: Low-hanging Fruit**
   
   Using the results of the intial recon, look for some easy wins. Search exploit-db and cve-details for vulns in frameworks/CMSes used in the app. Quickly investigate anything that immediately stands out as promising from your manual spidering (e.g. questionable aspects of the forgot-password process)
4. **Vulnerability-search: Higher-hanging Fruit**
   
   Investigate more closely the results of your recon. Look for any and all sources of client input, and explore how those might be exploited. Build up maps of authentication flows and similar, to help inform this process.
5. **Exploitation**

   Use the outputs of Steps 4 and 5 to exploit the app. Chain exploits where appropriate (e.g. utilise an unauthenticated privesc, then and authenticated RCE, to get a shell on the server)
6. **Post-exploitation**

   Switch to network/OS pentesting and privesc techniques if appropriate, and/or take steps to ensure persistence and stealth (clean out logs, drop a cronjob or modify app code to run the reverse shell, etc.)
7. **Writeup**
